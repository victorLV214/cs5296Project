			<p>
				You can use custom Crypt-Types, but you should decide during
				installation which Type of encryption you want to use. By default SCryptImplementation is used:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>org.apache.openmeetings.util.crypt.SCryptImplementation - does use
					SCrypt for password hashing with salt</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				You can edit the config-key during Installation or later in the
				Administration Panel. But if you change it using the
				Administration-Panel previous passwords will not work anymore
				as they are encrypted with another algorithm.

			<p>
				To add your own crypt style you need to write a class which
				implements the interface: org.apache.openmeetings.util.crypt.ICrypt
				<br />
				Example of an Implementation: <br />

				<br />

				<br />
			</p>
			<p>To add your own Encryption-Class you need to add your class to the
				OpenMeetings-Webapp (make it available to the webapp-classpath) and
				use your custom-class-name instead of
				org.apache.openmeetings.util.crypt.SCryptImplementation during the Installation or
				at runtime by editing the config-key <code>crypt.class.name</code></p>
